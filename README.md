# leaflet-challenge

- Created a map using Leaflet that plots all of the earthquakes from dataset based on their longitude and latitude.

- Markers reflect magnitude of earthquake by size and depth earthquake by color (higher magnitudes are larger and greater depths are darker in color).

- Included popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when a marker is clicked.

- Created a legend that provides context for data.
